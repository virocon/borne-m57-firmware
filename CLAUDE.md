# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## working conventions

**context switching:** when the user says `cd X`, treat it as a project context switch — that folder becomes the working root for the rest of the conversation. Resolve typos in project/folder names quietly (e.g. `m57_cloude` → `m57_claude`) without asking for confirmation.

**handoff documents are versioned, never overwritten:** each revision gets a new version suffix (`_v1`, `_v2`, …). When updating a handoff doc, create a new file — don't edit the previous version in place.

**always read the handoff doc before touching the claude keymap:** if a handoff doc exists for the project, read it first. Don't copy files or patch code without consulting it.

**workflow A — fresh implementation (from scratch):**
Use when starting a new project or fully rewriting an existing one.
1. analyze current state
2. write or update handoff doc (new version)
3. implement from scratch based on handoff doc
4. run sanity check
5. run code quality assessment
6. run comment audit and apply improvements
7. commit all changes (see git rule below)

**workflow B — ongoing work (fixes and new features):**
Use when adding to or modifying an existing implementation.
1. analyze affected code and understand current state
2. implement the fix or feature
3. run sanity check
4. run code quality assessment
5. commit all changes (see git rule below)

Steps 3–4 in workflow B and steps 4–6 in workflow A are **mandatory — never skip any step, regardless of how small the change is**.

**git: commit when implementation is complete:** after all workflow steps are done, stage all changed files. Before committing, compose a descriptive commit message, show it to the user, and ask for approval. Wait for the user to accept or provide edits before running `git commit`. Always include the Co-authored-by trailer:

## script logging

Before executing any inline PowerShell (`.ps1`) or Python (`.py`) script, save it as a named file in `C:\Users\KSCHULZ1\Code\borne-m57-firmware\cloude-files\`, then run it from there. Use a descriptive filename (e.g., `sanity_check.ps1`, `verify_json.py`). This applies to all scripts in any m57-related project.

## what this is

qmk/vial firmware drop-in for a split keyboard called **borne** (variant `m57`, based on foostan/crkbd/corne). not a standalone buildable project - it's a keyboard directory that gets copied into a qmk tree and built from there.

## layout

- `source/m57/` - the keyboard definition. drop into `qmk_firmware/keyboards/m57/` (or wherever your tree expects) to build
- `source/ld/` - linker scripts for stm32f401 (`QF_STM32F401.ld`, `PlumBL_STM32F401.ld`) and stm32l433 (`STM32L433xC.ld`). these go into `platforms/chibios/boards/.../ld/` in the qmk tree
- `source/borne_source_vendor.zip` + `source/m36.rar` - vendor-supplied source snapshots, reference only
- `firmware/borne_m57_via_*.uf2` - pre-built uf2 firmware images (vendor + a 10-layer variant)
- `vil_backups/*.vil` - user's saved vial layouts (json). not code, just keymap dumps

## build

assuming the qmk tree has this keyboard merged in as `m57`:

```
make m57:via
```

the vendor readme (`source/m57/readme.md`) references `make sh01/m36:via` which points at the older m36 variant under a `sh01/` subtree - use whatever path matches how you've placed it.

output format is `uf2` (see `rules.mk`: `FIRMWARE_FORMAT = uf2`, `UF2_FAMILY = 0xabcdf401`). flash by dropping the uf2 onto the mass-storage bootloader that appears when the board enters dfu.

there's no lint/test - qmk's own `qmk lint -kb m57` is the only check that applies.

## architecture notes

**split keyboard, master-right.** `config.h` sets `MASTER_RIGHT` and `SPLIT_HAND_PIN C1` with `SPLIT_HAND_PIN_LOW_IS_LEFT`. transport is full-duplex usart1 on A9/A10 at 19200 baud (`SELECT_SOFT_SERIAL_SPEED 5`). both halves run the same binary - hand detection decides role at boot.

**matrix is 10x7, not 5x7.** despite being a split, rows 0-4 are the left half and rows 5-9 are the right half in a single unified matrix (see `m57.h` `LAYOUT` macro). keymaps in `keymaps/via/keymap.c` mirror this - one `LAYOUT(...)` per layer covers both halves.

**leftkb/ and rightkb/ subdirectories** each define `I_AM_LEFT` / `I_AM_RIGHT` via their `config.h` and tweak `mcuconf.h` (left disables `STM32_PWM_USE_TIM3` because no rgb driver on that side). these look like per-half build variants but the empty `rules.mk` files mean they aren't wired up as separate targets in the current tree - treat them as reference/vendor artifacts unless extending the build system.

**rgb matrix: 58 leds, 29 per side**, ws2812 on pin A7 driven by pwm (`PWMD3` ch2). `m57.c` has two `g_led_config` blocks - the first (commented out) is for a smaller matrix; the live one maps the 10x7 matrix to led indices.

**storage: wear leveling over flash.** `EEPROM_DRIVER = wear_leveling` / `legacy`, 4kb logical / 8kb backing, so don't raise `DYNAMIC_KEYMAP_EEPROM_MAX_ADDR` past 4095 without growing the backing too. 10 dynamic layers, 15 macros.

**vial + via both enabled.** `keymaps/via/rules.mk` turns on `VIAL_ENABLE`, `VIALRGB_ENABLE`, `VIA_ENABLE`, and `VIAL_INSECURE` (lets vial unlock without the usual key combo). `vial.json` is the kle-style layout vial reads; `VIAL_KEYBOARD_UID` in `keymaps/via/config.h` identifies the board to vial.

## known rough edges

- `info.json` has a missing comma and stray trailing commas (around the `{"matrix": [9, 2], ...}` / `{"matrix": [9, 3], ...}` block near the end of the layout). qmk may warn or fail the lint step - fix only when it actually blocks a build, since qmk still parses it in many tool paths
- the `LAYOUT` macro in `m57.h` and the layout list in `info.json` have overlapping x/y coordinates on several keys (multiple keys at `x:4, y:0.2` etc.) - that's the vendor state, not necessarily wrong

## editing keymaps

two routes:
1. **source edit**: modify `source/m57/keymaps/via/keymap.c`, rebuild, reflash
2. **vial gui**: flash once, then use vial to edit layers/macros live - dumps back to `.vil` files like the ones in `vil_backups/`. these live in eeprom and survive reflash as long as the eeprom layout doesn't change

encoder behavior is in the `encoder_map` at the bottom of `keymap.c` (two encoders: left = pins B8/B9, right = pins B4/B6, both resolution 2).
